### **SelfAdjuster: Volatility-Aware AMM for Stacks**

The **SelfAdjuster** is a sophisticated Automated Market Maker (AMM) for DeFi liquidity pools on the Stacks blockchain. It extends the traditional constant-product AMM design with dynamic fee adjustment, volatility-aware pricing, and anti-MEV safeguards to provide a more resilient and secure trading environment.

### üöÄ **Key Features**

-   **Dynamic Fee Adjustment**: Trading fees automatically adjust based on market volatility using a calculated multiplier, with a maximum cap of 30%. This mechanism protects liquidity providers (LPs) by charging higher fees during volatile periods, helping to offset the risk of impermanent loss.

-   **Price Impact Protection**: The contract includes built-in slippage checks to ensure that traders receive fair pricing and to prevent large, malicious swaps from draining the pool.

-   **Advanced Liquidity Management**:

    -   LPs can add or remove liquidity, and LP tokens are minted/burned proportionally based on the geometric mean for initial deposits or proportional shares for subsequent ones.

    -   A minimum liquidity safeguard (`min-liquidity`) prevents the pool from being completely drained.

-   **Advanced Rebalancing**: The owner-only `advanced-rebalance-with-protection` function allows for controlled pool ratio corrections. It includes:

    -   **Anti-MEV Delays**: A time window (`time-window`) to mitigate front-running.

    -   **Dynamic Fee Multipliers**: Fees are adjusted during rebalancing to reflect current volatility.

    -   **K-constant Invariance Checks**: The contract ensures `newReserveX * newReserveY >= oldReserveX * oldReserveY`, a critical check to maintain the integrity of the pool's invariant.

-   **Emergency Controls**: The `emergency-stop-toggle` function provides the contract owner with a crucial failsafe to pause all core operations in case of abnormal volatility, exploits, or other emergencies.

### üìë **Contract Structure**

The contract's functions are organized into three distinct sections: **public**, **private**, and **read-only**.

#### **Public Functions**

These functions can be called by any user and are responsible for core interactions like adding liquidity or swapping tokens.

-   `add-liquidity(amount-x, amount-y, min-lp-tokens)`: Allows users to deposit tokens to the pool and receive LP tokens.

-   `remove-liquidity(lp-tokens, min-amount-x, min-amount-y)`: Enables users to burn their LP tokens to withdraw their share of the pool's assets.

-   `swap-x-for-y(amount-x, min-amount-y)`: Facilitates a token swap from X to Y, applying the dynamic fee and price protection.

-   `emergency-stop-toggle()`: An owner-only function to pause all major contract operations.

-   `advanced-rebalance-with-protection(target-ratio, max-slippage, time-window)`: An owner-only function to rebalance the pool.

#### **Private Functions**

These helper functions can only be called from within the contract itself. They handle the underlying logic and calculations.

-   `calculate-price-impact`: Determines the output amount of a swap based on the constant-product formula.

-   `update-volatility`: Updates the `volatility-factor` based on recent price changes.

-   `calculate-dynamic-fee`: Calculates the trading fee based on the current volatility.

-   `calculate-fee-read-only`: A non-mutating version of the fee calculation used for read-only views.

-   `mint-lp-tokens` & `burn-lp-tokens`: Handle the creation and destruction of LP tokens.

#### **Read-Only Functions**

These functions do not change the contract's state and can be called without a transaction. They are useful for querying information about the pool.

-   `get-reserves()`: Returns the current balances of both token reserves.

-   `get-lp-balance(user)`: Fetches the LP token balance for a specific user.

-   `get-current-fee()`: Returns the current dynamic trading fee.

-   `get-pool-info()`: Provides an aggregate view of the pool, including reserves, total supply, fee, volatility, and emergency status.

### **üõ† Deployment & Testing**

1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Deploy the contract** to the Stacks blockchain using [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/):

    Bash

    ```
    clarinet contract deploy self-adjuster

    ```

3.  **Initialize the pool** with liquidity using the `add-liquidity` function.

4.  **Run local tests** to ensure all functions operate as expected:

    Bash

    ```
    clarinet test

    ```

    This command will run the suite of tests covering edge cases for liquidity, fee adjustment, and emergency controls.

ü§ù Contributing
---------------

Contributions are very welcome! If you'd like to get involved, here's how you can do it:

1.  **Fork the repository.** This creates a copy of the project under your GitHub account.

2.  **Create a feature branch.** Use `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` to create a new branch for your changes.

3.  **Commit your changes.** Make your code changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive message (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).

4.  **Push to your branch.** Push your committed changes to your forked repository (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).

5.  **Open a Pull Request.** Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your new branch. This will allow the maintainers to review your contributions.

The project is built upon the foundational work of other leading AMMs like **Uniswap v2**, **Balancer**, and **Curve**. The SelfAdjuster builds on these established primitives to create a more advanced, volatility-aware solution tailored for the Stacks blockchain.
